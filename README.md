# Movies-Python-Analyst
## This project aims to analyze a dataset of movies using Python programming language. The dataset contains various features about each movie, including:

- rating: User rating of the movie
- genre: Movie genre(s)
- year_released: Year the movie was released
- score: Score given to the movie on a specific platform
-votes: Number of votes received by the movie
- director: Movie director(s)
- writer: Movie writer(s)
- star: Main star(s) of the movie
- country: Country where the movie was produced
- budget: Movie production budget
- gross: Total box office collection of the movie
- company: Production company of the movie
- runtime: Duration of the movie

## By analyzing this data, you can gain insights into various aspects of the movie industry, such as:
1) Popular movie genres and their trends over time
2) Relationship between budget, gross, and critical reception
3) Influence of director, writer, and stars on movie success
4) Movie production trends in different countries

## This project utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Specifically, I used:
- pandas: For efficiently managing and analyzing data structures
- numpy: For performing mathematical operations on arrays
- seaborn: For creating informative and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations
- datetime: For working with date and time data
- matplotlib.pyplot: For creating various types of plots and charts
- matplotlib.mlab: For generating probability density functions
- matplotlib.style: For customizing the overall look and feel of the plots
